APP DESCRIPTION

In this game, the player controls a rectangular paddle that is in a fixed position in the vertical
dimension but moves back and forth across the screen horizontally along with the mouse within
the bounds of the screen. A ball moves about the rectangular world and bounces off of surfaces it
hits. The world is also filled with rows of rectangular bricks that can be cleared from the screen
if the ball collides with them. The goal is to clear all bricks.
